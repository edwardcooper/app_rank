The only 3D radar on iPhone® and iPad®, Weather Lab is for people that want to get the most out of weather radar. Dive deep and analyze real-time NEXRAD Level 2 data in rich, interactive perspectives.Requires iPhone 6, iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 4 or newer.WHAT'S IN THE BOXThere are two levels of Weather Lab–one is a paid in-app subscription. Keep it simple or go deeper with advanced radar inspection tools and access to more NEXRAD Level 2 products. Both give you the richness, power, and fluid control you demand to help you gain an enhanced mental model of your surroundings.Weather Lab: Offers reflectivity and the radar views of scan (lowest scan) and volume.Weather Lab PRO: Access all five NEXRAD Level 2 products and all radar views (including all angle scans).See the comparison chart: https://weatherlab.com/#comparisonChartTHE POWER OF 3DThe Earth is not flat. Neither is the weather. The ability to view radar in 3D — the space in which it was captured — helps create a better mental model and improves situational awareness. Interacting with a more natural and fluid 3D environment assists you with the analysis of this complex visual information. To make this possible, we built it using Apple's high-performance Metal graphics layer.VIEWSGain deeper insights by displaying and cutting through radar volumes in different ways:Scan - Display radar in the form in which it was captured: A full circle scan pointing into the sky at a constant elevation angle. [Weather Lab: Lowest scan. Weather Lab PRO: Any scan in the current VCP.]Volume - View the radar as four combined 3D isosurfaces, giving you the at-a-glance ability to understand the big picture.Horizontal Slice (Weather Lab PRO) - Since any given scan ascends through the altitudes at an angle, a mental leap is required to understand what is happening at a single altitude. Now you have the ability to see a specific altitude.Vertical Slice (Weather Lab PRO) - Cut through the radar volume vertically, creating a ""wall"" of data to allow instant interpretation of what is happening through all altitudes at once.PRODUCTSLevel 2 NEXRAD Radar:- Reflectivity- Velocity (Weather Lab PRO)- Differential Reflectivity (Weather Lab PRO)- Correlation Coefficient (Weather Lab PRO)- Spectrum Width (Weather Lab PRO)NWS Warnings:- Tornado- Severe Thunderstorm- Flash Flood- Special MarineCOVERAGE SITESContiguous United States: 143Alaska: 7Hawaii: 4Republic of Korea: 2Guam: 1Japan: 1Puerto Rico: 1Total: 159DATA ACCESSNEXRAD radars continuously scan a 3D picture of the skies using one of several predetermined volume coverage patterns (VCP).

Description


Alimentor 2 is an essential tool for divorced parents who seek a fair recognition of their child‑raising efforts. No subscription fees. No in-app purchases.———App Store reviews of previously released versions (1.9.6 and earlier):“My only regret about this app is that I did not find it sooner.” - iDad7X“I honestly never take the time to write reviews for apps. Though, this app is SO worth the money. It is so helpful for noting parenting arrangements (especially when they change all the time), payments, and notes.” - Trezkholl0806“For those who have that problem with their Ex who is always placing blame and is untrustworthy, well this is the perfect tool!!  Document, document, document!!” - JA.Leyva“After a crazy divorce this is the perfect tool to keep records.” - MsSmith122“This app is everything you need in case you find yourself litigating with your ex in court for custody or child support. Since in California child support is calculated based on real parenting time, everything you need to do is to print out your calendars with parenting time/percentage from the app and attach it to your declaration/motion/RFO. Worked well for me.” - WShaunM———Key Features:• Track parenting time and expenses, attach photos and PDF documents • Control the timeshare percentage, total hours and overnights• Log late pick-ups, missed visitations and disagreements• Keep call history (date, time, duration), including unanswered calls• Compare actual visitation time with the established custody schedule• Plan ahead and reduce conflicts between parenting time and other events• Color-coded time bars show exact events duration• Contains built-in holidays calendar (US, CA, AU)• View your device calendar events in Alimentor• Create easy to read reports (.pdf) containing color-coded calendars• Layouts: Actual, Schedule, Actual vs. Schedule• Send reports to the other parent or lawyer, or submit to the court• Save your lawyer's time by providing “Best Interests of the Child” listing• Export all data to a spreadsheet file (.xlsx) for further processing• Securely backup, sync and share your data using Apple’s iCloud• No need to create an account or remember a new password• Avoid accidental data loss when your device is lost or damagedTo view sample documents visit alimentor.org.———1. STOP MISSING OUTYou can start by tracking past and current custody related events. Log parenting time and expenses (including receipts). Add photos. Store emails and other related documents as PDF attachments.2. START PLANNINGUse recurring events to model your custody schedule. Allow Alimentor to access your device calendar to see how your custody schedule aligns with holidays and other important family or business events. When editing individual planned visitations, check how these changes affect your timeshare. 3. STRENGTHEN CONTROLDocument and control the gap between your parenting plan and reality. Log no-shows, withheld visitations and unanswered calls. Use the disagreement flag to indicate situations when the other parent did not comply with the established parenting plan. Share your data with the other parent.———What is new (compared to Alimentor 1):• Storing multiple photos and PDF attachments in a single record• New record type “Call” for logging call history (date, time, duration)• New report chapter “Best Interests of the Child” • Enhanced report layout configuration options• Reporting scheduled and actual parenting time in the same calendar • Enhanced settings for creating recurring events • Simplified database sharing functionality based on standard iOS sharing UI• Data import from Alimentor 1.9.6 or laterIn order to make Alimentor 2 as simple to use as possible we have decided to abandon certain less popular features, including expense categories and Apple Watch app. If you are missing any functionality or if you have any questions about the app, please contact us at: feedback@alimentor.org.

Description


The RP Diet App was designed by nutritional experts and data scientists to do one thing and one thing only: GET YOU RESULTS! This app is NOT A TRACKER. You don't type in the foods or macros you eat. This app is a DIET DESIGNER and COACH. It tells you what to eat, not the other way around! There are tons of tracker apps out there, and many of them are very good. But this is one of the only diet coaching apps. If you're frustrated with your diet and just want a clear but flexible plan to follow, this is the app for you. The RP Diet App takes the uncertainty out of your hands and guides you every step of the way to your fitness goals. You log in and tell the app about yourself, including your current schedule. You also tell the app about your next goal. You can choose to lose fat, gain muscle, or maintain an athletic physique at peak performance. Based on the goal you choose, the app designs a custom diet that fits your schedule, but it doesn't choose your foods. For each meal, YOU get to choose the foods you eat from a long (and growing) list of healthy options, and the app automatically tells you how much of these foods to eat so that you're on track to meet the goal you set. The app will remind you when it's time to eat your meals and when it's time to step on the scale to track your progress. By inputting your weight just a few times a week, the app will automatically adjust your diet every week to keep you on track.What does this mean? It means that you don't have to fret or worry about your diet anymore. You just have to choose your favorite healthy foods, eat when the app reminds you, and watch your body transform. When you have serious goals, don't leave them to chance. Leave them to science.While the app accommodates countless ways of eating, it's not yet currently configured to support vegan diets or the schedules of night shift workers. Both updates are coming VERY soon, and the vegan diet option is already well underway in development and promises to be very, very powerful and easy to use. We're always working to make the app better, so stay tuned!RP Diet offers the following subscriptions options:• RP Diet Monthly Subscription: $14.99 (USD) per month with a 2 week free trial • RP Diet Yearly Subscription: $149.99 (USD) per year with a 2 week free trialBoth options will give you full, unlimited access to all features, including meal planning, shopping list, and reminders for a 2 week trial, after which you will be charged the full subscription price of the tier to which you subscribed.These prices apply to United States residents. Prices may vary in other countries respecting your local currency exchange rate. Your subscription will be charged to your iTunes account. At the end of the term, unless auto-renewable subscriptions are disabled, your subscription will automatically renew in your iTunes account. You will be charged for the regular price of your subscription within 24 hours prior to the end of the current term. You can turn off automatic renewal in your iTunes account settings at any time, but you must do so at least 24 hours before the end of the current term.

Description


Founded in 1999, The Chap takes a satirical look at the modern world through the eyes of an old-fashioned English gentleman. The Chap seeks to maintain decorum, standards and, above all, correct dress, and it goes about this by celebrating the great dandies and gentlemen of the past, as well as casting a critical eye over the rather disappointing dress habits of today. Readers are invited to send their photos in for a sartorial assessment and these are reproduced in the “Am I Chap?” section. Elsewhere, one may read interviews with notable living Chaps such as Chris Eubank, Sir Roger Moore, Adam Ant and Donald Sinden. The principal gentlemanly pursuits are also given coverage: Gambling at the horses; Grooming (with particular emphasis on moustache cultivation); Cricket (written by Wisden regular Steve Pittard); Drinking (especially cocktails); Dressing Up (in which every sartorial detail, from waistcoats to slippers to pocket watches, is covered). The Chap also features an in-house butler, who is on hand to answer all your queries of a socio-sartorial nature. Whether you truly want to adopt the lifestyle of the dandy or the gentleman, or simply wish to keep yourself informed of the latest developments in cravat usage and pipe tobaccos, The Chap is the only British publication entirely devoted to celebrating the arts of the gentleman. --------------- This is a free app download.

NDT Work Log replaces the time consuming process of writing down all of your work experience hours into a paper logbook with an easy to use mobile phone app. Almost everyone always has their phone on or around them, so for those pursuing a career in non-destructive testing, why carry around a booklet with hand-written work experience hours when you can store it all in your phone instead?NDT Work Log solves that.The NDT Work Log app is a utility application that makes keeping up with your NDT work experience hours as convenient as ever. With a few taps, you can make a work log entry in seconds for 11 different NDT methods. Make that entry as thorough as you like with options to include pictures, work order numbers, part numbers, and any extra notes for reference. The app then adds up all of your total hours in each method and then compares it to the NDT requirements for certification. It lists the hours required, the hours that you have completed, and how many hours remain as you enter job entries and work hours into the log. This information can be shared through email to supervisors, employers, or the technician with options to create reports in Excel Spreadsheet, PDF, and Text File formats that can be downloaded and stored for records.Features:    Easy and intuitive interface    Choose from 11 NDT methods    Make entries as thorough as you like    Automatically adds total hours to show your progress    Create reports in PDF, .txt, and Excel formats that can be sent through email*****IMPORTANT INFORMATION*****YOUR NDT WORK LOG EXPERIENCE IS STORED ON YOUR APP NOT ON YOUR PHONE.

The only 3D radar on iPhone® and iPad®, Weather Lab is for people that want to get the most out of weather radar. Dive deep and analyze real-time NEXRAD Level 2 data in rich, interactive perspectives.Requires iPhone 6, iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 4 or newer.WHAT'S IN THE BOXThere are two levels of Weather Lab–one is a paid in-app subscription. Keep it simple or go deeper with advanced radar inspection tools and access to more NEXRAD Level 2 products. Both give you the richness, power, and fluid control you demand to help you gain an enhanced mental model of your surroundings.Weather Lab: Offers reflectivity and the radar views of scan (lowest scan) and volume.Weather Lab PRO: Access all five NEXRAD Level 2 products and all radar views (including all angle scans).See the comparison chart: https://weatherlab.com/#comparisonChartTHE POWER OF 3DThe Earth is not flat. Neither is the weather. The ability to view radar in 3D — the space in which it was captured — helps create a better mental model and improves situational awareness. Interacting with a more natural and fluid 3D environment assists you with the analysis of this complex visual information. To make this possible, we built it using Apple's high-performance Metal graphics layer.VIEWSGain deeper insights by displaying and cutting through radar volumes in different ways:Scan - Display radar in the form in which it was captured: A full circle scan pointing into the sky at a constant elevation angle. [Weather Lab: Lowest scan. Weather Lab PRO: Any scan in the current VCP.]Volume - View the radar as four combined 3D isosurfaces, giving you the at-a-glance ability to understand the big picture.Horizontal Slice (Weather Lab PRO) - Since any given scan ascends through the altitudes at an angle, a mental leap is required to understand what is happening at a single altitude. Now you have the ability to see a specific altitude.Vertical Slice (Weather Lab PRO) - Cut through the radar volume vertically, creating a ""wall"" of data to allow instant interpretation of what is happening through all altitudes at once.PRODUCTSLevel 2 NEXRAD Radar:- Reflectivity- Velocity (Weather Lab PRO)- Differential Reflectivity (Weather Lab PRO)- Correlation Coefficient (Weather Lab PRO)- Spectrum Width (Weather Lab PRO)NWS Warnings:- Tornado- Severe Thunderstorm- Flash Flood- Special MarineCOVERAGE SITESContiguous United States: 143Alaska: 7Hawaii: 4Republic of Korea: 2Guam: 1Japan: 1Puerto Rico: 1Total: 159DATA ACCESSNEXRAD radars continuously scan a 3D picture of the skies using one of several predetermined volume coverage patterns (VCP).

""Spdr is the Swiss Army Knife of reading apps."" -Enzo, Spdr readerPeople normally read at a rate of 150-200 words per minute. With Spdr (pronounced “Speeder”), you can instantly double that without even trying and still retain the same amount of information. There is no learning or effort required. Watch the app preview videos above to experience it before downloading. Then, download Spdr and try it out for yourself for free.Here's how Spdr works:Spdr displays words one-by-one, with Punctuation Pauses giving Spdr a natural and seamless feel.  Rather than moving your eyes across and down a page like you normally would, Spdr allows you to absorb text as it is presented. This means your eyes don't have to work as hard, enabling you to read and retain more text faster without your eyes getting tired and fatiguing.We recommend starting at double the average adult reading speed, or 300-400 words per minute, and working your way up as you feel comfortable.Spdr is free for you to try in order to see whether the technique works for you:(1) Simply copy most links or any text and paste into the text box in Spdr(2) Set your desired words-per-minute rate(3) Hold down anywhere on the screen to start, and lift to pauseUpgrade to Spdr Pro. Pay once. No subscription. No sign up:Because Spdr is so powerful and useful, upgrade to Spdr Pro for a nominal one-time fee and receive unlimited feature access. Spdr truly is the ""killer reading app,"" because it saves you time. You'll never want to read anything without it again. Spdr Pro includes:(1) Save text for later and read on Apple Watch(2) Speed-read PDFs, Word docs, books (.epub files) and more(3) Read & save Spdr from Apple News and your favorite websites.(4) Use the text image recognition camera to snap or upload pics of book pages and read them in Spdr(5) Get all advanced controls, including Sans/Serif/Monospace mode, text alignment mode, light mode, and word skip(6) Lifetime reading stats(7) Remove all ads forever(8) All future features includedSpdr for Apple Watch:Spdr is the first app ever to make reading on Apple Watch truly delightful. Spdr is seamlessly integrated to fit the Apple Watch interface, with its simple yet comprehensive functionality, one-word-at-a-time reading method, press-and-release controls, and intuitive use of the Apple Watch's hardware components, like adjusting your reading speed with the Digital Crown. Read anything effortlessly on Apple Watch with one simple press gesture. No scrolling, repetitive tapping, or swiping necessary. Simply open Spdr on your Apple Watch, adjust the word-per-minute rate with the Digital Crown, and start reading. Spdr on Apple Watch is great for any situation where you don't want to take your iPhone or iPad out. Spdr synchs seamlessly between Apple Watch and your device. Spdr for Apple Watch is available only with the Spdr Pro upgrade.  Enjoy!DM @spdrapp on Instagram with questions, feedback, and to view helpful how-to videos.Notice:Rapidly flashing content may have adverse effects on individuals prone to seizures. If this is you, please use Spdr with caution. Link pasting and app extensions work better for some URLs and websites than they do for others.  Image text recognition camera results may vary depending on text and image quality, including the surface of where the text appears. Certain features are limited on Apple Watch. watchOS 5.1 or later is required to run Spdr on Apple Watch.  An Internet connection is required when pasting links, and may be required when using the Spdr Pro-available app extensions to share content to Spdr. File support includes .epub, .pdf, .doc, .docx, .rtf, .html, and more. Spdr does not currently support .fb2 and .mobi ebook file types. ePub books protected by DRM (Digital Rights Management) are not supported. Jailbroken devices are not supported.

Description


The Rebel app will help you build relationships with the most important people in your network.Our success in life and business is directly linked to the people we surround ourselves with - the more successful they are, the more successful we become.To build effective relationships, we need to invest in the right people. If we can help others achieve their GOALS, they, in turn, will want to help us. This is known as ‘reciprocity’ - in other words, ‘if I help you, then you will want to help me’ - and is fundamental to relationship building.When we go to the gym, or play a sport, we record our scores and therefore know if we are doing enough to generate results. In relationship building and networking, we don’t know what the impact is and how to measure it. This app allows you to record your efforts in building networks with the right people and marketing yourself through these relationships.The app has two main purposes:1. To record activities that you can do to help your network to build goodwill and relationships so they will be compelled to help in return.2.To record activities you need to be doing for yourself to generate visibility and credibility in your networking groups and market industry.Your GOAL is a weekly score of 100 points. The app also allows you to email your activity to a coach for additional accountability.One important thing to note: scores are attained by doing this FOR other people, i.e. investing in relationships. If you are selling or taking from other people, then this should not be recorded.-------------------------------Subscription InformationProduct Name: Network LeadersMonthly Plan: $1.99/monthYearly Plan: $14.99/yearYour subscription payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at the confirmation of your purchase.

TS is the transgender dating app that’s great at one thing: catering to the desires of transgenders, crossdressers and the admires of trans people. Trans dating is the best way for individuals in transgendered community (such as MTF & FTM transsexuals, transvestites (TV's)/ crossdresser (CD's), drag queens, drag kings, female impersonators, male impersonators & everyone else who loves the 'Trans' community) to find the casual dating or long term relationships, even the marriage. As we all know, most of the major online dating networks are very unfriendly when it comes to transgender dating. Just as the real world does not often accept trans people, the mainstream dating sites or apps are quite similar. Most of the mainstream dating networks do not even include the specific features for trans people. We understand that it’s very hard for transgender people to find friends, romance or love in real world or online dating. So we developed this TS dating app that only caters to trans people and their admirers. TS dating is a private and safe place where you can get involved with the transgender dating scene without having to worry about being misunderstood, criticized, prejudged. Grindr is for gay, TS is the specific dating app for trans people. We hope that TS will be another grindr in Trans community. There is an increasing number of trans singles around the world who are looking to meet and date MTF and FTM. If you are one of them and seeking like-minded people, this is the right trans dating app for you. What are you waiting for? There is nothing to lose on a transgender dating app. Join us now!Subscription Details:· A subscription gives you full access to TS service.· Join our membership today and subscribe for only $6.58/month!Please note:· Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.· Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.· Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.· Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.· You cannot cancel the current subscription during the active subscription period.· Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.· Terms of Service: http://transgenders.app/agreement.html· Privacy Policy: http://transgenders.app/privacy.html· TS Dating App is safe and secure with full protection· You must be at least 17 years old to download and use this App.

Get helpful pregnancy articles published by top experts every few days.Have a crush on someone? Want to see what a baby would look like if you were a couple? Snap pictures of you two, and that baby will be smiling at you in nine seconds instead of nine months!Based on Luxand biometric identification technologies, BabyMaker applies complex science to deliver hours of fun. Instead of blending the two faces together, the innovative technology identifies facial features in the two source pictures, creates their mathematical representations, and applies powerful calculations to create a model describing a new face that looks like a younger version of the two “parents”. Based on that mathematical model, BabyMaker renders a new face and makes a perfect photo collage showing you two and your baby.Like that cutie superstar? Superstars like BabyMaker! Have hours of fun by making babies online with whoever you want! Just snap a selfie and pick that other parent, and you’ll see a baby of you two in an instant. You need nothing but a picture of your face to get started!Strive for perfections? For best results, make sure to use two frontal pictures taken in good lighting conditions. You can use a good selfie, yet the higher-quality source you submit, the more convincing result you will get.Since lighting condition may vary, BabyMaker may have a hard time detecting the face. If that happens, try using a photo taken in better lighting conditions. In addition, please help us achieve great results by manually selecting your baby’s skin tone as Light, Medium, Dark or Asian.Want your baby laugh? Just submit pictures of the two parents smiling, and you’ll see a happy face! Want a serious-looking child? Place a lemon in front of you, look straight at the camera, and we can almost guarantee that serious look.Save your baby’s face to a photo album or share it with friends by sending a text message or email or posting to Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Whatsapp.Still not convinced? Try a different pair of photos of you two, and you’ll get a slightly different baby.Finally, we’re not fortune-tellers, and neither is BabyMaker. Use just for fun, and have fun!BabyMaker contains $3.99/week with 7-day free trial period.

""Spdr is the Swiss Army Knife of reading apps."" -Enzo, Spdr readerPeople normally read at a rate of 150-200 words per minute. With Spdr (pronounced “Speeder”), you can instantly double that without even trying and still retain the same amount of information. There is no learning or effort required. Watch the app preview videos above to experience it before downloading. Then, download Spdr and try it out for yourself for free.Here's how Spdr works:Spdr displays words one-by-one, with Punctuation Pauses giving Spdr a natural and seamless feel.  Rather than moving your eyes across and down a page like you normally would, Spdr allows you to absorb text as it is presented. This means your eyes don't have to work as hard, enabling you to read and retain more text faster without your eyes getting tired and fatiguing.We recommend starting at double the average adult reading speed, or 300-400 words per minute, and working your way up as you feel comfortable.Spdr is free for you to try in order to see whether the technique works for you:(1) Simply copy most links or any text and paste into the text box in Spdr(2) Set your desired words-per-minute rate(3) Hold down anywhere on the screen to start, and lift to pauseUpgrade to Spdr Pro. Pay once. No subscription. No sign up:Because Spdr is so powerful and useful, upgrade to Spdr Pro for a nominal one-time fee and receive unlimited feature access. Spdr truly is the ""killer reading app,"" because it saves you time. You'll never want to read anything without it again. Spdr Pro includes:(1) Save text for later and read on Apple Watch(2) Speed-read PDFs, Word docs, books (.epub files) and more(3) Read & save Spdr from Apple News and your favorite websites.(4) Use the text image recognition camera to snap or upload pics of book pages and read them in Spdr(5) Get all advanced controls, including Sans/Serif/Monospace mode, text alignment mode, light mode, and word skip(6) Lifetime reading stats(7) Remove all ads forever(8) All future features includedSpdr for Apple Watch:Spdr is the first app ever to make reading on Apple Watch truly delightful. Spdr is seamlessly integrated to fit the Apple Watch interface, with its simple yet comprehensive functionality, one-word-at-a-time reading method, press-and-release controls, and intuitive use of the Apple Watch's hardware components, like adjusting your reading speed with the Digital Crown. Read anything effortlessly on Apple Watch with one simple press gesture. No scrolling, repetitive tapping, or swiping necessary. Simply open Spdr on your Apple Watch, adjust the word-per-minute rate with the Digital Crown, and start reading. Spdr on Apple Watch is great for any situation where you don't want to take your iPhone or iPad out. Spdr synchs seamlessly between Apple Watch and your device. Spdr for Apple Watch is available only with the Spdr Pro upgrade.  Enjoy!DM @spdrapp on Instagram with questions, feedback, and to view helpful how-to videos.Notice:Rapidly flashing content may have adverse effects on individuals prone to seizures. If this is you, please use Spdr with caution. Link pasting and app extensions work better for some URLs and websites than they do for others.  Image text recognition camera results may vary depending on text and image quality, including the surface of where the text appears. Certain features are limited on Apple Watch. watchOS 5.1 or later is required to run Spdr on Apple Watch.  An Internet connection is required when pasting links, and may be required when using the Spdr Pro-available app extensions to share content to Spdr. File support includes .epub, .pdf, .doc, .docx, .rtf, .html, and more. Spdr does not currently support .fb2 and .mobi ebook file types. ePub books protected by DRM (Digital Rights Management) are not supported. Jailbroken devices are not supported.
